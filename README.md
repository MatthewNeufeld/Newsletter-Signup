# Newsletter Signup

A newsletter signup form for a fictitious company as a full-stack web application. I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to
construct the front-end, and I used Node.js and Express.js for the back-end. Once the user enters their information into the
HTML forms, their data is sent to the MailChimp API and stored in their database. This application was also deployed live to the
internet using Heroku when free plans were available.
